The team grade focuses on evaluating your team's collaborative approach and the quality of the final product. To achieve a "Godk√§nt" grade, your team must:

-   Document your way of working
-   Specify the technologies used
-   Describe conflict resolution strategies
-   Implement Scrum/Kanban methodologies
-   Create a backlog of tickets
-   Ensure each ticket has a User Story
-   Define Acceptance Criteria for each ticket
-   Develop a sprint or Kanban board(s) where every ticket is clearly represented and progresses across the board
-   Assign numbers to tickets for easy reference
-   Create appropriate development branches in the repository (e.g., development and master)
-   Establish corresponding Vercel (or alternative) environments linked to the relevant branches
-   Develop the two applications as detailed by Jolint:
    -   Customer consent form
    -   Client dashboard
-   Ensure that the applications are completed (or as close as possible) by the due date, and the 'master' branch is bug-free
-   Attend regular stand-up meetings
-   Present the status of the projects to the client on a weekly basis
